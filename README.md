# Red-Wine-Quality
This project is about checking if we can guess the quality of red wine using its chemical details. The dataset winequality-red.csv has information like acidity, sugar, alcohol, and more. Each wine also has a quality score.

In the code, we load the dataset, look at the data, and then separate it into inputs (wine properties) and output (wine quality). We split the data into two parts: one for training the model and one for testing it.

We use a machine learning model called Random Forest. The model learns from the training data and then makes guesses on the test data. We check how good it is by looking at accuracy, a report of scores, and a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix is also shown as a heatmap so it is easy to see.

This project is a simple way to show how machine learning can predict wine quality using data
